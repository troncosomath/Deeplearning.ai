## Understanding and Applying Text Embeddings
This course present intuition on embedding. The course has 6 lecture each very focus on developing intution and hand-on experince using VertexAI client.
- Create embeddings using `textembedding-gecko@001`
- Compute Cosine Similarity using the package on `sklearn`
- Load stackoverflow question/answer/tags from `BigQuery`
- Get embeddings on stackoverflow data by sending batches 
- Load LLM `text-bison@001`
- Dicusssion on `Temperature`, `Top p`, `Top k`. 
- Semantic Search 
    - Compute cosine similarity with ALL embedding respect to the question
    - Improve by creating index using `ScaNN`. Then find clossest embedding to the question.
    - Use LLM to decide use relevant information or provide not answer if closest embedding is not applicable.
